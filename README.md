## Description of myself   <a name="description"></a>

I started using computers since the age of 5 and have a love & passion for technology. I first started out playing 2D retro PC games such as Doom and other well known PC Games. I knew that when I got older I wanted to work on computers and to make this my career in life. I graduated from the University of Masachusetts Boston with my Bachelors Degree in Computer Science, at my time in Umass I learned a lot of useful programming tools & introduced me to my first coding projects. After I graduated from Umass I struggled finding employment, I graduated in the midst of a pandemic and had to take an entry level IT job. I didn't enjoy the atmosphere as I had to take this job only due to being a recent graduate in a shutdown economy with no industry experience at all. After my time working in IT, I got 2 job offers and ended up going as a Site Reliability Engineer. 


## Job Career     <a name="jobcareer"></a>

I work as a site reliability engineer full time for a life insurance company. I work on solving tickets submitted by other employees and try to resolve the issues for theese tickets. They range from aws issues, policy adjustments, terraform modules, EKS clusters & much more. I have been working here for 7 months and have been exposed to a lot of new tools that I am still learning a long the way

## Future Aspirations    <a name="aspirations"></a>

I aspire to get my masters degree from Boston University to further my understanding of software development & to help me at my role as a site reliability engineer and help me in my career path down the line. I enjoy working with computers and hope to be a team leader of an SRE group one day
